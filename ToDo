# rules :
    -   cannot use any native type of variables to the language chosen for the management of complex numbers.
    -   No library easing the management of complex numbers/matrices is authorized.
    -   You are responsible for the proper installation of the dump environment on which
                you will be developing and on which you will be corrected.

# Mandatory :

    •   answer specifications
        ◦ Rational numbers.
        ◦ Complex numbers (with rational coefficients).
        ◦ Matrices.
        ◦ Polynomial equations of degrees less than or equal to 2.

    • Assignment of an expression to a variable by type inference
    • Reassignment of an existing variable with an expression of another type
    • Assignment of a variable to another variable (existing or not)
    • Resolution of a mathematical expression with or without defined variable (s)
    • Resolution of an equation of degree less than or equal to 2
    • Operations between types, as much as possible
    • Exit the program itself (by keyword, signal, keyboard shortcut ...)
